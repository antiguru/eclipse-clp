ECLiPSe on UNIX/Linux  (see README_WIN for Windows, README_MACOSX for MacOSX)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unpacking
---------

You should have gotten the following files, either on CD or by ftp.
There are different versions of these files for different machine
architectures. These are tar-files compressed with gzip.

Base:
    README_UNIX			The file you are reading now
    UNPACK			Unpacking script (Unix)
    eclipse_basic.tgz		Kernel and basic libraries
    eclipse_doc_online.tgz	Documentation (html,txt,man)
    eclipse_doc_print.tgz	Documentation (pdf)

Optional:
    eclipse_misc.tgz		Free/3rd party libraries
    eclipse_misc_nc.tgz		Free libraries not for commercial use
    if_osiclpcbc.tgz            Interface to COIN-OR's open source solvers 
                                CLP and CBC
    eclipse_source.tgz		Source code for selected ECLiPSe libraries

Support:
    tcltk.tgz			A matching Tcl/Tk release (8.4)
    				(you may have that already).
				Needed for the tkeclipse development GUI.

These other files are only needed under special circumstances:
    eclipse_rt.tgz		Runtime only (subset of eclipse_basic.tgz)
    if_cplexXY.tgz		Interface to CPLEX(r) version XY
    if_xpressXY.tgz		Interface to XPRESS-MP version XY


Make a directory for ECLiPSe on your machine (in the following
we will write this directory as <eclipsedir>) and move the
distribution files there.

Uncompress and untar the files in this directory using

    % ./UNPACK

This will create the ECLiPSe directory structure below the
current directory.

Note that you can always add optional components later without
having to repeat the installation process below.


Installation
------------

Now run the installation script:

    % ./RUNME

This will prompt you for the necessary information and create
the eclipse executables in <eclipsedir>/bin/<arch> (where <arch>
stands for one of the supported machine architectures).


To run ECLiPSe
--------------

Add <eclipsedir>/bin/<arch> to your PATH, e.g.

    % PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/eclipse/bin/sparc_sunos5		(sh/bash)
 or
    % setenv path ($path /usr/local/eclipse/bin/sparc_sunos5)	(csh)

It is normally not necessary to set any environment variables in order
to run eclipse. ECLiPSe is simply called from the command line as:

    % eclipse		(command-line interface)
or
    % tkeclipse		(GUI version, needs Tcl/Tk)

If you use the ECLiPSe embeddable library, your may have to set
$LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include <eclipsedir>/lib/<arch> to enable
the dynamic linker to find it.


Further notes on installation
-----------------------------

The ECLiPSe installation directory may be shared between machines
with different hardware/operating system architectures, e.g.
i386_linux and sparc_sunos5. To do so, just unpack the distributions
for the different architectures in the same installation directory.
All architecture-dependent files will go in separate subdirectories.

When you are doing the installation on a networked file system, it is
recommended that you specify to the installation script a pathname
under which the directory can be found on all the client machines. 
If there is no such unique pathname, then users will have to set the
environment variable ECLIPSEDIR according to where the directory can
be found on the machine they are on.


Documentation
-------------

The installation subdirectory <eclipsedir>/doc contains html and pdf
versions of the user documentation. To read the html documentation,
set your browser to e.g.

    file:<eclipsedir>/doc/index.html


The printable documentation is contained in the files:

    tutorial.pdf	Tutorial

    userman.pdf		Basic user manual

    libman.pdf		Library user manual (constraints libraries)

    embedding.pdf	Interfacing and embedding manual

The Reference Manual (the detailed descriptions of the built-in
predicates and all the libraries) is available exclusively in html
format and via the help/1 predicate from within ECLiPSe.

Unix man pages are under

    <eclipsedir>/man


Installation hints for the 'eplex' library
----------------------------------------------

The ECLiPSe 'eplex' library is an interface to an external commercial
Xpress-MP or CPLEX LP/MIP solver.

If you own a separate Xpress-MP or CPLEX licence, then you can use
the 'eplex' library with the corresponding solver. In this case, you
need to download a version of 'eplex' that matches the version of the
Xpress-MP or CPLEX licence that you have (although it may be possible to
run an older version with a newer licence). For example, for Xpress-MP X.Y,
you need the package if_xpressXY.tgz.  Similarly, if you have CPLEX X.Y
you need the package if_cplexXY.tgz.  You can install a mix of different
versions by just unpacking multiple packages.

To tell ECLiPSe which licence you have on which machine, add the
necessary lines to the text file <eclipsedir>/lib/eplex_lic_info.ecl,
according to the instructions provided there.  With this setup, you
can load the eplex library from ECLiPSe by just invoking lib(eplex),
and you will get the correct version for each machine.

Academic licences for CPLEX are available from ILOG at
    http://www.ilog.com/partners/academic/license.cfm
Academic licences for XPRESS-MP are available from Dash Optimization at
    http://www.dashoptimization.com/home/users/app.html


Graphics
--------

The Embedding Interface and the TkEclipse Development Environment require
Tcl/Tk version 8.3 or later.  If this is already installed on your machine
(normally the case on Linux), you can use your existing installation by
giving the version and the location of the corresponding library
directories (e.g. /usr/lib) to the RUNME install program.

Alternatively, you can use the tcltk.tgz package which comes with the
ECLiPSe distribution. This goes into the tcltk subdirectory of the
ECLiPSe installation. To make Tcl/Tk/scripts find the files, you
may have to add <eclipsedir>/tcltk/<arch>/bin to your PATH and
possibly add <eclipsedir>/tcltk/<arch>/lib to your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Several visualisation features require Java. The recommended version
is at least 1.4, but versions from 1.2 upwards should still work.


Emacs ECLiPSe mode
------------------

If you use the GNU emacs editor, an ECLiPSe mode is now provided for it.
**Version 20 (or later) of GNU emacs is required.** This mode is based
on the prolog mode by Umeda, and provides extensive syntax colouring 
for ECLiPSe-specific features. See http://www.gnu.org/ if you need more 
information on GNU and its software. 

In order to use this mode, add the following line to your .emacs file:

(autoload 'eclipse-mode "<eclipsedir>/lib_public/eclipse.el" "ECLIPSE editing mode" t)

where <eclipsedir> is the path to your ECLiPSe installation directory.

You may also need to add these lines so that the .pl and .ecl extensions
are recognised to be ECLiPSe programs:

(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.pl" . eclipse-mode) auto-mode-alist))
(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.ecl" . eclipse-mode) auto-mode-alist))

See the start of the eclipse.el file for some instructions on using this mode.
