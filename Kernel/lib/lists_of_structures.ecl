    This library contains predicates that operate on lists of structures,
    in particular structures where one argument can be considered a `key'.
    Such lists are very common, and often occur in sorted form.
    </p><p>
    The ECLiPSe kernel and other libraries support such lists as well, e.g.
<UL>
    <LI>the sorting built-ins (sort/4, merge/5, number_sort/4, number_merge/5)
    <LI>hash:list_to_hash/4 for turning such lists into hash tables
</UL>
    </p><p>
    If you have declared your structures using the
    :- local(struct(...)) declaration, then you can use field names to
    identify the key arguments in all these predicates, e.g.
<PRE>
    :- local struct(emp(name,age,salary)).
    ?- Emps = [emp{name:joe,salary:100}, emp{name:bob,salary:200}],
       sort(salary of emp, >=, Emps, Descending),

    Emps = [emp(joe, _, 100), emp(bob, _, 200)]
    Descending = [emp(bob, _, 200), emp(joe, _, 100)]

% (b) for each Clump in Clumps, all the elements of Clump are identical
% (==). Items must be a proper list of terms for which sorting would
% have been sound. In fact, it usually is the result of sorting.

For example,

clumps([m, i, s,s, i, s,s, i, p,p, i],
[[m],[i],[s,s],[i],[s,s],[i],[p,p], [i]])

% keyclumps(+Pairs, ?Clumps)
% is true when Pairs is a list of pairs and Clumps a list of lists
% such that
% (a) append(Clumps, Pairs)
% (b) for each Clump in Clumps, all of the Key-Value pairs in Clump
% have identical (==) Keys.
% Pairs must be a proper list of pairs for which keysorting would have
% been sound. In fact, it usually is the result of keysorting.

This isn't quite what you want.

% clumped(+Items, ?Counts)
% is true when Counts is a list of Item-Count pairs such that
% if clumps(Items, Clumps), then each Item-Count pair in Counts
% corresponds to an element [Item/*1*/,...,Item/*Count*/] of Clumps.
% Items must be a proper list of terms for which sorting would have
% been sound. In fact, it usually is the result of sorting.

For example,
clumped([m, i, s,s,i, s,s,i, p,p,i],
[m-1,i-1,s-2,i-1,s-2,i-1,p-2,i-1])

% keyclumped(+Pairs, ?Groups)
% is true when Pairs is a list of Key-Item pairs and
% Groups is a list of Key-Items pairs such that
% if keyclumps(Pairs, Clumps), then for each K-[I1,...,In] pair in
% Groups there is a [K-I1,...,K-In] clump in Clumps.
% Pairs must be a proper list of pairs for which keysorting would have
% been sound. In fact, it usually is the result of keysorting.

This, I think, is the one you want.

I dislike the name join_by_key/2 (because it is NOT a join) about as
much as I dislike the name keyclumped (because it really isn't obvious
what it means; back in 1989 I still had a lot to learn about naming).

The obvious other such predicate is

transpose(Pairs, Transposed) :-
'flip for transpose'(Pairs, Flipped),
keysort(Flipped, Transposed).

'flip for transpose'([], []).
'flip for transpose'([Key-Val|Pairs], [Val-Key|Flipped]) :-
'flip for transpose'(Pairs, Flipped).
