ECLiPSe on MacOSX  (see README_WIN for Windows, README_UNIX for UNIX/Linux)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Please read INSTALL first if you are compiling from source. You do not
need the binary files described here.

Note that the PowerPC and Intel versions of Mac OS X are distinguished by
ECLiPSe; the Power PC version is ppc_macosx, and the Intel version is 
i386_macosx.

Unpacking
---------

You should have gotten the following files, either on CD or by ftp.
There are different versions of these files for different machine
architectures. These are tar-files compressed with gzip.

If you are downloading from SourceForge, these file names may have
additional version (and platform) specification like

     eclipse_basic_5_10_57_i386_linux.tgz 

that are required to make the filename unique. 

Base:
    eclipse_basic.tgz		Kernel and basic libraries 
                                (either the i386_macosx or ppc_macox version,
				depending on your platform)
    eclipse_doc.tgz		Documentation (html,txt,man,pdf)

Optional:
    eclipse_misc.tgz		Free/3rd party libraries
    if_osiclpcbc.tgz            Interface to COIN-OR's open source solvers 
                                CLP and CBC

Support:
    tcltk.tgz			A matching Tcl/Tk release (8.4)
    				(you may have that already).
				Needed for the tkeclipse development GUI.
    editors_eclipse_support.tgz Support for various editors for editing
                                ECLiPSe code.       

These other files are only needed under special circumstances:
    eclipse_rt.tgz		Runtime only (subset of eclipse_basic.tgz)


Note: The unpacking and installation of ECLiPSe is done using Unix
methods. We are not yet providing some Mac-specific method of packaging 
ECLiPSe.

Make a directory for ECLiPSe on your machine (in the following
we will write this directory as <eclipsedir>) and move the
distribution files there.

Uncompress and untar the files in this directory using tar, e.g.

    % tar -zxvf eclipse_basic.tgz

for each file downloaded.

This will create the ECLiPSe directory structure below the
current directory. [replace eclipse_basic.tgz with the name of the package
you are untaring]

Note that you can always add optional components later without
having to repeat the installation process below.


Installation
------------

If you are installing from source, first compile ECLiPSe as described in
the file INSTALL (see also the file document/internal/SetupGuide.doc for 
more detailed help). After compiling ECLiPSe, you can run the installation 
script as described below.

If you are installing from the binary packages, run the installation script:

    % ./RUNME

This will prompt you for the necessary information and create
the eclipse executables in <eclipsedir>/bin/<arch> (where <arch>
stands for one of the supported machine architectures).


To run ECLiPSe
--------------

Add <eclipsedir>/bin/<arch> to your PATH, e.g.

    % PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/eclipse/bin/ppc_macosx		(sh/bash)
 or
    % setenv path ($path /usr/local/eclipse/bin/ppc_macosx)	(csh)

It is normally not necessary to set any environment variables in order
to run eclipse. ECLiPSe is simply called from the command line as:

    % eclipse		(command-line interface)
or
    % tkeclipse		(GUI version for Aqua, needs Aqua Tcl/Tk)
or
    % xtkeclipse        (GUI version for X11, needs X11 and X11 Tcl/Tk)

If you use the ECLiPSe embeddable library, your may have to set
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to include <eclipsedir>/lib/<arch> to enable
the dynamic linker to find it.


Further notes on installation
-----------------------------

The ECLiPSe installation directory may be shared between machines
with different hardware/operating system architectures, e.g.
i386_linux and sparc_sunos5. To do so, just unpack the distributions
for the different architectures in the same installation directory.
All architecture-dependent files will go in separate subdirectories.

When you are doing the installation on a networked file system, it is
recommended that you specify to the installation script a pathname
under which the directory can be found on all the client machines. 
If there is no such unique pathname, then users will have to set the
environment variable ECLIPSEDIR according to where the directory can
be found on the machine they are on.


Documentation
-------------

The installation subdirectory <eclipsedir>/doc contains html and pdf
versions of the user documentation. To read the html documentation,
set your browser to e.g.

    file:<eclipsedir>/doc/index.html


The printable documentation is contained in the files:

    tutorial.pdf	Tutorial

    userman.pdf		Basic user manual

    libman.pdf		Library user manual (constraints libraries)

    embedding.pdf	Interfacing and embedding manual

The Reference Manual (the detailed descriptions of the built-in
predicates and all the libraries) is available exclusively in html
format and via the help/1 predicate from within ECLiPSe.

Unix man pages are under

    <eclipsedir>/man


Graphics
--------

The Embedding Interface and the TkEclipse Development Environment require
Tcl/Tk version 8.3 or later.  If this is already installed on your machine,
you can use your existing installation by giving the version and the
location of the corresponding library directories (e.g. /usr/lib) to the
RUNME install program.

Some functions for TkECLiPSe are accessed through the right-mouse button.
If you have the standard one-button mouse from Apple, you can still access
these functions with control-clicking the mouse button instead.

On MacOSX, TkEclipse is available in both the native Aqua and X11 windowing
environments. You need to have X11 installed to run the X11 version. In
recent versions of MacOSX, Tcl/Tk (for Aqua) is installed by default. The
tcltk.tgz package contains the X11 version of Tcl/Tk, which is not
available by default. If you don't have the Aqua version of Tcl/Tk, you can
download it in either source or binary form from links at www.tcl.tk.

X11 is shipped with recent versions of MacOSX, and can be downloaded free
of charge for older versions of MacOSX. 

Several visualisation features require Java. The recommended version
is at least 1.4, but versions from 1.2 upwards should still work.

Emacs ECLiPSe mode
------------------

If you use the GNU emacs editor, an ECLiPSe mode is now provided for it.
It is not part of the ECLiPSe distribution, and you need to download it
separately. **Version 20 (or later) of GNU emacs is required.** This mode
is based on the prolog mode by Umeda, and provides extensive syntax
colouring for ECLiPSe-specific features. See http://www.gnu.org/ if you
need more information on GNU and its software.

In order to use this mode, add the following line to your .emacs file:

(autoload 'eclipse-mode "<eclipsedir>/lib_public/eclipse.el" "ECLIPSE editing mode" t)

where <eclipsedir> is the path to your ECLiPSe installation directory.

You may also need to add these lines so that the .pl and .ecl extensions
are recognised to be ECLiPSe programs:

(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.pl" . eclipse-mode) auto-mode-alist))
(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.ecl" . eclipse-mode) auto-mode-alist))

The eclipse.el file needs to be placed somewhere where your emacs can find
it.

See the start of the eclipse.el file for some instructions on using this mode.
