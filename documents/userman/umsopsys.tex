\label{chapopsys}

\section{Introduction}

{\eclipse}'s operating system interface consists of a collection of built-in
predicates and some global flags that are accessed with \bipref{set_flag/2}{../bips/kernel/env/set_flag-2.html},
\bipref{get_flag/2}{../bips/kernel/env/get_flag-2.html} and \bipref{env/0}{../bips/kernel/env/env-0.html}. They are described in the following sections.
The interface is mostly compatible across Unix and Windows operating systems.

\section{Environment Access}
A number of predicates and global flags is provided to get more or less
useful information from the operating system environment.
\subsection{Command Line Arguments}
Arguments provided on the UNIX (or DOS) command line are accessed by the builtins
\index{command line options}
\index{argc/1}
\index{argv/2}
\bipref{argc/1}{../bips/kernel/opsys/argc-1.html} which gives the number of command line arguments (including
the command name itself) and \bipref{argv/2}{../bips/kernel/opsys/argv-2.html} which returns a requested positional
argument in string form. If the first argument of {\bf argv/2} is the atom
all, then a list of all command line arguments is returned.

\subsection{Environment Variables}
On UNIX, environment variables are another way to pass information to the
{\eclipse} process. Their string value can be read using \bipref{getenv/2}{../bips/kernel/opsys/getenv-2.html}:
\index{getenv/2}
\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}
[eclipse 1]: getenv('HOME', Home).

Home = "/usr/octopus"
yes.
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}

The environment variables available on Window is version dependent, and is
not a recommended method of passing information.

\subsection{Exiting {\eclipse}}
When {\eclipse} is exited, it can give a return code to the operating system.
This is done by using \bipref{exit/1}{../bips/kernel/opsys/exit-1.html}. It exits {\eclipse} and returns its integer
argument to the operating system.
\index{exit/1}
\index{halt/0}
\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}
[eclipse 1]: exit(99).
csh% echo $status
99
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}
Note that {\bf halt} is equivalent to {\bf exit(0)}.

\subsection{Time and Date}
The current date can be obtained in the form of a UNIX date string:
\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}
[eclipse 1]: date(Today).

Today = "Tue May 29 20:49:39 1990\n"
yes.
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}
The library {\bf calendar} contains a utility predicate to convert
this string into a Prolog structure.
Another way to access the current time and date is the global flag
{\bf unix_time}. It returns the current time in the traditional UNIX
measure, i.e. in seconds since 00:00:00 GMT Jan 1, 1970:
\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}
[eclipse 1]: get_flag(unix_time, Now).

Now = 644008011
yes.
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}
Other interesting timings concern the resource usage of the running {\eclipse}.
The \bipref{statistics/2}{../bips/kernel/env/statistics-2.html} builtin gives three different times, the user
cpu time, the system cpu time and the elapsed real time since
the process was started (all in seconds):
\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}
[eclipse 1]: statistics(times, Used).

Used = [0.916667, 1.61667, 2458.88]
yes.
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}
The first figure (user cpu time) is the same as given by \bipref{cputime/1}{../bips/kernel/opsys/cputime-1.html}.

\subsection{Host Computer}
Access to the name and unique identification of the host computer where
the system is running can be obtained by the two global flags
\index{get_flag/2}
\index{hostname}
\index{hostid}
{\bf hostname} and {\bf hostid}, accessed via \bipref{get_flag/2}{../bips/kernel/env/get_flag-2.html} or
\bipref{env/0}{../bips/kernel/env/env-0.html}. These flags might not be available on all machines,
\bipref{get_flag/2}{../bips/kernel/env/get_flag-2.html} fails in these cases.

\subsection{Calling C Functions}
Other data may be obtained with the predicate \bipref{call_c/2}{../bips/kernel/externals/call_c-2.html}
which allows to call directly any C function which is
linked to the Prolog system.
Functions which are not linked can be loaded dynamically with the
\bipref{load/1}{../bips/kernel/externals/load-1.html} predicate.


\section{File System}
A number of built-in predicates is provided for dealing with files and
directories.
Here we consider only the file as a whole, for opening files and accessing
their contents refer to chapter \ref{chapio}.

\subsection{Current Directory}
The current working directory is an important notion in UNIX.
It can be read and changed within the {\eclipse} system by using \bipref{getcwd/1}{../bips/kernel/opsys/getcwd-1.html} and
\bipref{cd/1}{../bips/kernel/opsys/cd-1.html} respectively.
\index{cd/1}
\index{getcwd/1}
The current working directory is accessible as a global flag as well.
Reading and writing this flag is equivalent to the use of \bipref{getcwd/1}{../bips/kernel/opsys/getcwd-1.html} and
\bipref{cd/1}{../bips/kernel/opsys/cd-1.html}:
\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}
[eclipse 1]: getcwd(Where).

Where = "/usr/name/prolog"
yes.
[eclipse 2]: cd(..).

yes.
[eclipse 3]: get_flag(cwd, Where)

Where = "/usr/name"
yes.
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}
All {\eclipse} built-ins that take file names as arguments accept absolute
pathnames as well as relative pathnames starting at the current directory.

\subsection{Looking at Directories}
To look at the contents of a directory, \bipref{read_directory/4}{../bips/kernel/opsys/read_directory-4.html} is available.
\index{read_directory/4}
It takes a directory pathname and a filename pattern and returns a list
of subdirectories and a list of files matching the pattern.
The following metacharacters are recognised in the pattern:
* matches an arbitrary sequence of characters,
? matches any single character, [] matches one of the
characters inside the brackets unless the first one is a \^\space\space
in which case it matches any character but those inside the brackets.
\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}
[eclipse 1]: read_directory("/usr/john", "*", Dirlist, Filelist).
Dirlist = ["subdir1", "subdir2"]
Filelist = ["one.c", "two.c", "three.pl", "four.pl"]
yes.
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}

\subsection{Checking Files}
For checking the existence of files,
\bipref{exists/1}{../bips/kernel/opsys/exists-1.html} or the more powerful
\bipref{existing_file/4}{../bips/kernel/opsys/existing_file-4.html} is used.
\index{exists/1}
\index{existing_file/4}
For accessing any file properties there is \bipref{get_file_info/3}{../bips/kernel/opsys/get_file_info-3.html}.
\index{get_file_info/3}
It can return file permissions, type, owner, size, inode, number of
links as well as creation, access and modification times
(as defined by the UNIX system call {\it stat(2)}; not all entries are
meaningful under Windows), and accessibility
information.
It fails when the specified file does not exist.
\index{get_file_info/2}
Refer to the reference manual or \bipref{help/1}{../bips/kernel/env/help-1.html} for details.

\subsection{Renaming and Removing Files}
For these basic operations with files, \bipref{rename/2}{../bips/kernel/opsys/rename-2.html} and \bipref{delete/1}{../bips/kernel/opsys/delete-1.html}
are provided.
\index{rename/2}
\index{delete/1}

\subsection{Filenames}
The filenames used by {\eclipse} is in the Unix format, including on Window
platforms, with the addition that the disk such as \verb+C:+ is
indicated by \verb+//C/+, so a Windows filename such as
\verb+"C:\my\path\name.ecl"+ should be writen as
\verb+"//C/my/path/name.pl"+. The utility \bipref{os_file_name/2}{../bips/kernel/opsys/os_file_name-2.html} provides for
the interconversion between the format used in {\eclipse} and the Operating
Systems' format.  

The utility \bipref{pathname/4}{../bips/kernel/opsys/pathname-4.html}
is provided to ease the handling of filenames.
\index{pathname/4}
It takes a full pathname and cuts it into the directory
pathname, the filename proper and a suffix (
the part beginning with the last dot in the string).
It also expands symbolic pathnames, starting with \verb$~$, \verb$~$user
or \$var.
\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}
[eclipse 1]: Name = "~octopus/prolog/file.pl",
        pathname(Name, Path, File, Suffix).

Path = "/usr/octopus/prolog/"
File = "file.pl"
Name = "~octopus/prolog/file.pl"
Suffix = ".pl"
yes.
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}


\section{Creating Communicating Processes}
{\eclipse} provides all the necessary built-ins needed to create UNIX processes
and establish communication between them.
A {\eclipse} process can communicate with other processes via streams and by
sending and receiving signals.

\subsection{Process creation}
\index{sh/1}
\index{exec/2}
\index{exec/3}
\index{exec_group/3}
The built-ins of the {\bf exec} group and \bipref{sh/1}{../bips/kernel/opsys/sh-1.html}
fork a new process and execute the command given as the first argument.
Sorted by their versatility, there are:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf sh(Command)}
\item {\bf exec(Command, Streams)}
\item {\bf exec(Command, Streams, ProcessId)}
\item {\bf exec_group(Command, Streams, ProcessId)}
\end{itemize}
\index{system/1}
With \bipref{sh/1}{../bips/kernel/opsys/sh-1.html} (or its synonym \bipref{system/1}{../bips/kernel/opsys/system-1.html}) it is possible to
call and execute any UNIX command from withing {\eclipse}.
However it is not possible to communicate with the process.
Moreover, the {\eclipse} process just waits until the command has been executed.

The {\bf exec} group makes it possible to set up communication links
with the child process by specifying the {\tt Streams} argument.
It is a list of the form
\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}
[Stdin, Stdout, Stderr]
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}
and specifies which {\eclipse} stream should be connected to the
{\it stdin}, {\it stdout} or {\it stderr} of the child respectively.
Unless {\tt null} is specified, this will establish pipes to be
created between the {\eclipse} process and the child.
On Berkeley UNIX systems the streams can be specified as {\it sigio(Stream)}
which will setup the pipe such that the signal {\it sigio} is issued
every time new data appears on the pipe.
Thus, by defining a suitable interrupt handler, it is possible to service this
stream in a completely asynchronous way.

\subsection{Process control}
The \bipref{sh/1}{../bips/kernel/opsys/sh-1.html} and \bipref{exec/2}{../bips/kernel/opsys/exec-2.html} built-ins both block the {\eclipse} process until
the child has finished.
For more sophisticated applications, the processes have to run in parallel
and be synchronised explicitly.
This can be achieved with \bipref{exec/3}{../bips/kernel/opsys/exec-3.html} or \bipref{exec_group/3}{../bips/kernel/opsys/exec_group-3.html}.
These return immediately after having created the child process and
unify its process identifier ({\it Pid}) with the their argument.
The Pid can be used to 
\begin{itemize}
\item send signals to the process, using the built-in {\bf kill(Pid, Signal)}
\item wait for the process to terminate and obtain its return status
{\bf wait(Pid, Status)}
\end{itemize}
\index{wait/2}
\index{kill/2}
The difference between \bipref{exec/3}{../bips/kernel/opsys/exec-3.html} and \bipref{exec_group/3}{../bips/kernel/opsys/exec_group-3.html} is
that the latter creates a
new process group for the child, such that the child does not get the
interrupt, hangup and kill signals that are sent to the parent.

The process identifier of the running {\eclipse} and of its parent process are
available as the global flags {\bf pid} and {\bf ppid} respectively.
\index{pid (global flag)}
\index{ppid (global flag)}
\index{get_flag/2}
They can be accessed using \bipref{get_flag/2}{../bips/kernel/env/get_flag-2.html} or \bipref{env/0}{../bips/kernel/env/env-0.html}.

Here is an example of how to connect the UNIX utility {\bf bc} (the
arbitrary-precision arithmetic language) to a {\eclipse} process.
We first create the process with two pipes for the child's standard input
and output.
Then, by writing and reading these streams, the processes can communicate in
a straightforward way. Note that it is usually necessary to flush the
output after writing into a pipe:
\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}
[eclipse 1]: exec(bc, [in,out], P).

P = 9759
yes.
[eclipse 2]: writeln(in, "12345678902321 * 2132"), flush(in).

yes.
[eclipse 3]: read_string(out, "\n", _, Result).

Result = "26320987419748372"
yes.
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}
In this example the child process can be terminated by closing its standard
input (in other cases it may be necessary to send a signal).
The built-in \bipref{wait/2}{../bips/kernel/opsys/wait-2.html} is then used to wait for the process to terminate
and to obtain its exit status.
Don't forget to close the {\eclipse} streams that were opend by \bipref{exec/3}{../bips/kernel/opsys/exec-3.html}:
\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}
[eclipse 4]: close(in), wait(P,S).

P = 9759
S = 0     More? (;) 
yes.
[eclipse 5]: at_eof(out), close(out).

yes.
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}

\subsection{Interprocess Signals}
The UNIX (or the appropriate Windows) signals are all mapped to {\eclipse} interrupts.
Their names and numbers may vary on different machines.
Refer to the operating system documentation for details.

The way to deal with incoming signals is to define a Prolog or external
predicate and declare it as the interrupt handler for this interrupt
(using \bipref{set_interrupt_handler/2}{../bips/kernel/event/set_interrupt_handler-2.html}).
Interrupt handlers can be established for all signals except those that are
not allowed to be caught by the process (like e.g.\ the {\it kill} signal 9).
For a description of event handling in general see chapter \ref{chapexcept}.

\index{kill/2}
For explicitly sending signals to other processes \bipref{kill/2}{../bips/kernel/opsys/kill-2.html} is provided,
which is a direct interface to the UNIX system call {\it kill(2)}.
Note that some signals can be set up to be raised automatically,
e.g.\ {\tt sigio} can be raised when data arrives on a pipe.
